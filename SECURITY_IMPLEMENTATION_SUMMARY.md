# 🔐 Security Implementation Summary

## ✅ What Was Implemented

Your global client selection feature is now **fully secure** with enterprise-grade authorization and access control.

### Security Features Added

1. **✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

   - Admin, Manager, and User roles
   - Admins can access all clients
   - Others only access assigned clients

2. **✅ Authorization Policy**

   - `ClientPolicy` enforces permissions
   - Users can only select authorized clients
   - 403 error for unauthorized attempts

3. **✅ Middleware Validation**

   - Validates selected client on every request
   - Auto-clears if access is revoked
   - Prevents session hijacking

4. **✅ Granular Access Levels**

   - Read, Write, Admin access levels
   - Stored in `client_user` pivot table
   - Fine-grained permission control

5. **✅ Controller Authorization**
   - All client operations check permissions
   - Users only see their accessible clients
   - Can't select clients they don't have access to

## 🚀 How to Enable Security

### Step 1: Run Migrations

```bash
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate
```

This creates:

- `role` field in users table
- `client_user` pivot table

### Step 2: Set User Roles

**Option A - Via Tinker:**

```bash
docker-compose exec app php artisan tinker
```

```php
// Make yourself an admin
$user = \App\Models\User::where('email', 'your@email.com')->first();
$user->role = 'admin';
$user->save();
```

**Option B - Via Database:**

```sql
UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your@email.com';
```

**Option C - Use Test Seeder:**

```bash
docker-compose exec app php artisan db:seed --class=UserClientSeeder
```

Creates:

- admin@example.com (admin role)
- manager@example.com (manager role)
- user@example.com (user role)
- All passwords: **password**

### Step 3: Assign Client Access

**For Non-Admin Users**, assign them to clients:

```php
// Via Tinker
$user = \App\Models\User::find($userId);
$user->clients()->attach($clientId, ['access_level' => 'read']);

// Or sync multiple
$user->clients()->sync([
    1 => ['access_level' => 'read'],
    2 => ['access_level' => 'write'],
]);
```

**Note**: Admins automatically have access to all clients.

### Step 4: Test It!

1. Login as admin → Should see all clients
2. Login as regular user → Should see only assigned clients
3. Try selecting unauthorized client → Should get 403 error
4. Remove user's access → Selected client auto-clears

## 🎯 Key Concepts

### User Roles

```
admin    → Can access ALL clients (no restrictions)
manager  → Can access assigned clients (can create/update)
user     → Can access assigned clients (read-only)
```

### Access Levels (in client_user table)

```
read   → Can view client only
write  → Can view and update client
admin  → Full control over client
```

### Authorization Flow

```
1. User clicks "Select Client"
2. ClientPolicy::select() checks permission
3. If authorized → Store in session
4. If denied → Return 403 error

On every request:
5. ValidateSelectedClient middleware runs
6. Verifies user still has access
7. If not → Auto-clear and show warning
```

## 🔍 How It Prevents Unauthorized Access

### ❌ Attack Vector: User tries to select unauthorized client

**Protection**: `ClientPolicy::select()` denies, returns 403

### ❌ Attack Vector: User crafts POST to `/clients/{id}/select`

**Protection**: Controller calls `authorize('select', $client)` first

### ❌ Attack Vector: Session hijacking with selected client

**Protection**: Middleware validates on every request

### ❌ Attack Vector: User's access revoked but client still selected

**Protection**: Middleware auto-clears invalid selections

### ❌ Attack Vector: Direct database manipulation

**Protection**: All access goes through policy, never trusts session alone

## 📊 Database Schema

### Users Table (Modified)

```sql
-- Added field:
role VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'user'  -- admin, manager, user
```

### Client-User Pivot Table (New)

```sql
CREATE TABLE client_user (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    client_id BIGINT REFERENCES clients(id),
    user_id BIGINT REFERENCES users(id),
    access_level VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'read',  -- read, write, admin
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(client_id, user_id)
);
```

## 🔧 Maintenance

### Add New User with Client Access

```php
$user = User::create([
    'name' => 'John Doe',
    'email' => 'john@example.com',
    'password' => Hash::make('password'),
    'role' => 'user'  // or 'manager' or 'admin'
]);

// Assign to clients (skip if admin)
$user->clients()->attach([
    1 => ['access_level' => 'read'],
    2 => ['access_level' => 'write'],
]);
```

### Check User's Current Access

```php
$user = User::find($userId);

// Get role
echo $user->role;

// Get accessible clients
$clients = $user->accessibleClients()->get();

// Check specific client
if ($user->canAccessClient($client)) {
    echo "Has access";
}
```

### Revoke Access

```php
$user->clients()->detach($clientId);
```

### Update Access Level

```php
$user->clients()->updateExistingPivot($clientId, [
    'access_level' => 'write'  // upgrade from read to write
]);
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Admin users bypass all restrictions** - Be careful who gets admin role
2. **Middleware runs on every request** - Ensures real-time validation
3. **Session data is not trusted** - Always validated against database
4. **Policy is the source of truth** - All permissions flow through ClientPolicy
5. **Access can be revoked anytime** - Changes take effect immediately

## 🚨 Rollback (If Needed)

If you need to rollback the security features:

```bash
# Rollback migrations
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate:rollback --step=2

# This will remove:
# - role field from users
# - client_user pivot table
```

**Note**: Without these, the ClientPolicy and middleware will fail. You'd need to remove/disable them too.

## ✨ What's Next?

Security is fully implemented! You can now:

1. **✅ Run migrations** to enable security
2. **✅ Assign roles** to your users
3. **✅ Assign client access** to non-admin users
4. **✅ Test thoroughly** with different user roles
5. **✅ Deploy with confidence** - It's secure!

Optional enhancements:

- Add logging/auditing for compliance
- Build admin UI for managing user-client assignments
- Add email notifications when access is granted/revoked
- Implement access request workflow
- Add time-based access (expiration dates)

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check `SECURITY_SETUP.md` troubleshooting section
2. Verify migrations ran successfully
3. Ensure roles and access are set correctly
4. Check Laravel logs: `storage/logs/laravel.log`
