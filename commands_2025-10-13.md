# Commands and Setup Instructions - October 13, 2025

## Global Client Selection with Security Implementation

This document contains all the steps, commands, and instructions for implementing the secure global client selection feature in your Laravel 12 application.

---

## Part 1: Initial Global Client Selection Setup

### What Was Implemented First

- Global variable system to store selected client
- Session-based storage
- Helper functions for easy access
- View sharing across all Blade templates

### Files Created (Initial Implementation)

1. `app/Helpers/ClientHelper.php` - Helper class for client operations
2. `app/helpers.php` - Global helper functions
3. `GLOBAL_CLIENT_USAGE.md` - Usage documentation

### Files Modified (Initial Implementation)

1. `app/Http/Controllers/ClientController.php` - Added select/clear methods
2. `resources/views/clients/index.blade.php` - Added selection UI
3. `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php` - Share client with all views
4. `routes/web.php` - Added selection routes
5. `composer.json` - Autoload helper functions
6. `resources/views/dashboard.blade.php` - Show selected client

### Commands Run (Initial Setup)

```bash
# Regenerate composer autoload
docker-compose exec app composer dump-autoload
```

---

## Part 2: Security Implementation

### Security Features Added

- ✅ Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- ✅ Authorization Policy (ClientPolicy)
- ✅ Middleware Validation (ValidateSelectedClient)
- ✅ Granular Access Levels (read/write/admin)
- ✅ User-Client Access Control (pivot table)

### Step-by-Step Commands

#### Step 1: Create Policy

```bash
docker-compose exec app php artisan make:policy ClientPolicy --model=Client
```

**File Created**: `app/Policies/ClientPolicy.php`

#### Step 2: Create Migrations

```bash
# Add role field to users table
docker-compose exec app php artisan make:migration add_role_to_users_table --table=users

# Create client-user pivot table
docker-compose exec app php artisan make:migration create_client_user_table
```

**Files Created**:

- `database/migrations/2025_10_13_172926_add_role_to_users_table.php`
- `database/migrations/2025_10_13_172937_create_client_user_table.php`

#### Step 3: Create Middleware

```bash
docker-compose exec app php artisan make:middleware ValidateSelectedClient
```

**File Created**: `app/Http/Middleware/ValidateSelectedClient.php`

#### Step 4: Create Seeder (Optional - for test data)

```bash
docker-compose exec app php artisan make:seeder UserClientSeeder
```

**File Created**: `database/seeders/UserClientSeeder.php`

#### Step 5: Run Migrations

```bash
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate
```

**What This Does**:

- Adds `role` field to users table (admin, manager, user)
- Creates `client_user` pivot table for access control

#### Step 6: Seed Test Users (Optional)

```bash
docker-compose exec app php artisan db:seed --class=UserClientSeeder
```

**What This Creates**:

- admin@example.com (password: password) - Admin role
- manager@example.com (password: password) - Manager role
- user@example.com (password: password) - User role

   - Added `select()` method for client selection authorization

4. **app/Http/Controllers/ClientController.php**

   - Added authorization checks
   - Filter clients by user access
   - Validate client selection with `authorize()`

5. **app/Http/Middleware/ValidateSelectedClient.php**

## Part 4: Post-Installation Setup

### Step 1: Set User Roles

#### Option A: Using Tinker (Recommended)

```bash
docker-compose exec app php artisan tinker
```

```php
// Make a user an admin
$user = \App\Models\User::where('email', 'your@email.com')->first();
$user->role = 'admin';
$user->save();

// Make a user a manager
$user = \App\Models\User::where('email', 'manager@email.com')->first();
$user->role = 'manager';
$user->save();

// Regular users default to 'user' role
```

#### Option B: Using SQL

```sql
-- Set user as admin
UPDATE users SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your@email.com';

-- Set user as manager
UPDATE users SET role = 'manager' WHERE email = 'manager@email.com';
```

### Step 2: Assign Users to Clients (For Non-Admin Users)

#### Option A: Using Tinker

```bash
docker-compose exec app php artisan tinker
```

```php
// Assign single client to user
$user = \App\Models\User::find($userId);
$user->clients()->attach($clientId, ['access_level' => 'read']);

// Assign multiple clients to user
$user->clients()->sync([
    1 => ['access_level' => 'read'],
    2 => ['access_level' => 'write'],
    3 => ['access_level' => 'admin'],
]);

// Assign all clients to all users (DEVELOPMENT ONLY)
$users = \App\Models\User::all();
$clients = \App\Models\Client::all();

foreach ($users as $user) {
    foreach ($clients as $client) {
        $user->clients()->syncWithoutDetaching([
            $client->id => ['access_level' => 'read']
        ]);
    }
}
```

#### Option B: Using SQL

```sql
-- Give user ID 2 read access to client ID 1
INSERT INTO client_user (client_id, user_id, access_level, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES (1, 2, 'read', NOW(), NOW());

-- Give user ID 3 write access to client ID 1
INSERT INTO client_user (client_id, user_id, access_level, created_at, updated_at)
VALUES (1, 3, 'write', NOW(), NOW());
```

## Part 5: Testing the Security

### Test 1: Admin User

```bash
# Login as: admin@example.com (if seeded)
# Expected: Should see ALL clients
# Expected: Can select any client
```

### Test 2: Regular User with Access

```bash
# Login as: user@example.com (if seeded)
# Expected: Should only see assigned clients
# Expected: Can only select assigned clients
```

### Test 3: Unauthorized Client Selection

```bash
# Login as regular user
# Try to select a client you don't have access to
# Expected: 403 Forbidden error
```

### Test 4: Access Revocation

```bash
# 1. Login and select a client
# 2. Remove user's access (via database or tinker)
# 3. Refresh any page
# Expected: Selected client auto-clears with warning message
```

### Remove Access Test (via Tinker)

```bash
docker-compose exec app php artisan tinker
```

```php
// Remove user's access to a client
$user = \App\Models\User::find($userId);
$user->clients()->detach($clientId);
```

## Part 6: Common Maintenance Commands

### View All Routes

```bash
docker-compose exec app php artisan route:list | grep client
```

### Clear Sessions (Force Re-validation)

```bash
docker-compose exec app php artisan session:clear
```

### Clear All Caches

```bash
docker-compose exec app php artisan cache:clear
docker-compose exec app php artisan config:clear
docker-compose exec app php artisan view:clear
```

### Rollback Migrations (If Needed)

```bash
# Rollback last 2 migrations (role field and pivot table)
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate:rollback --step=2
```

### Fresh Migration (DANGER - Wipes Database)

```bash
docker-compose exec app php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

---

## Part 7: Database Structure

### Users Table (Modified)

```sql
-- Added field:
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN role VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'user' AFTER email;
```

### Client-User Pivot Table (New)

```sql
CREATE TABLE client_user (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    client_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    user_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    access_level VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'read',
    created_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NULL,
    UNIQUE KEY (client_id, user_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (client_id) REFERENCES clients(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

---

## Part 8: Usage Examples

### In Controllers

```php
// Check if user can access a client
if (auth()->user()->canAccessClient($client)) {
    // User has access
}

// Authorize (throws 403 if denied)
$this->authorize('select', $client);

// Get user's accessible clients
$clients = auth()->user()->accessibleClients()->get();

// Check user role
if (auth()->user()->isAdmin()) {
    // User is admin
}
```

### In Blade Templates

```blade
{{-- Check if client is selected --}}
@if(hasSelectedClient())
    <p>Currently viewing: {{ selectedClient()->name }}</p>
@endif

{{-- Get selected client ID --}}
{{ selectedClientId() }}

{{-- Authorization checks --}}
@can('select', $client)
    <button>Select Client</button>
@else
    <span>No Access</span>
@endcan
```

### Helper Functions Available

```php
// Check if a client is selected
hasSelectedClient(); // Returns true/false

// Get selected client object
selectedClient(); // Returns Client model or null

// Get selected client ID
selectedClientId(); // Returns int or null
```

## Part 10: Roles and Access Levels

### User Roles

| Role        | Can View All Clients  | Can Create Clients | Can Update Clients         | Can Delete Clients |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **admin**   | ✅ Yes                | ✅ Yes             | ✅ Yes                     | ✅ Yes             |
| **manager** | ❌ No (assigned only) | ✅ Yes             | ✅ Yes (with write access) | ❌ No              |
| **user**    | ❌ No (assigned only) | ❌ No              | ❌ No                      | ❌ No              |

### Access Levels (in client_user pivot table)

| Level     | Can View | Can Update | Can Manage |
| --------- | -------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| **read**  | ✅ Yes   | ❌ No      | ❌ No      |
| **write** | ✅ Yes   | ✅ Yes     | ❌ No      |
| **admin** | ✅ Yes   | ✅ Yes     | ✅ Yes     |

---

## Part 11: Routes Added

```php
// In routes/web.php

// Select a client (stores in session)
POST /clients/{client}/select
Route name: clients.select

// Clear selected client (removes from session)
POST /clients/clear
Route name: clients.clear

// View clients list (with authorization)
GET /clients
Route name: clients.index
```

---

## Part 12: Troubleshooting

### Issue: 403 error when selecting client

**Solution**: Check `client_user` table, ensure user has access to that client

```bash
docker-compose exec app php artisan tinker
```

```php
$user = \App\Models\User::find($userId);
$user->clients()->attach($clientId, ['access_level' => 'read']);
```

### Issue: Can't see any clients

**Solution**: Either set role to 'admin' OR assign clients in `client_user` table

```php
// Make user admin (sees all clients)
$user->role = 'admin';
$user->save();

// OR assign specific clients
$user->clients()->attach($clientId, ['access_level' => 'read']);
```

### Issue: Selected client keeps clearing

**Solution**: User lost access, check permissions and verify client still exists

### Issue: Everyone can see all clients

**Solution**: Verify migrations ran, check ClientController uses authorization
